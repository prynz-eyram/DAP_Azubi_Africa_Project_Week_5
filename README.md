# DAP_Azubi_Africa_Project_Week_5
This is my fifth individual project as an Azubi Africa DAP participant.


In this project, I created a simple program to calculate mortgage using python to produce the following result.

input

- mortgage loan principal

  principal = 100000

- percent annual interest

  interest = 7.5

- years to pay off mortgage

  years = 30


output

 
 result ...

 
For a 30-year mortgage loan of $100,000

 
at an annual interest rate of 7.50%

 
you pay 

 
$699.21 monthly

 
----------------------------------------

 
Total amount paid will be $251,717.22
